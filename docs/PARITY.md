# Parity

Every capability ships on all three platforms or it does not ship, and the
conformance harness keeps this table honest. The public APIs are idiomatic
per platform but share the same shapes: Session, LensRegistry,
CaptureOutput, Events.

| Depth post-passes (depth-of-field, depth fog, depth-edge outline) | proven in the host harness: a depth gradient blurs off the focus plane and hazes the far side, a depth step draws a toon outline, each with a reference lens and a proof | built, no hardware yet | built |
| Motion trail (temporal echo of the previous frame) | proven in the host harness: the frame right after a scene cut still carries the previous frame's echo, with a reference lens and a proof | built, no hardware yet | built |
| Screen-space reflection (depth-gated reflective floor) | proven in the host harness: a near depth wets the floor with a mirrored reflection where a far one stays dry, with a reference lens and a proof | built, no hardware yet | built |
| Procedural sky dome behind the foreground (pose-driven env.pass) | proven in the host harness: tilting the submitted camera pose pans the sky behind the segmented subject, with a reference lens and a proof | built, no hardware yet | built |
| Equirect environment map (image env.pass sampled by pose) | proven in the host harness: yawing the camera pans a shipped equirect panorama behind the segmented subject, with a reference lens and a proof | built, no hardware yet | built |
| Material graph shaders (node-graph fragment shaders lowered to GLSL) | proven in the host harness: authored graphs compile and render, with reference lenses and a conformance proof | built, no hardware yet | built |
| glTF animation mixer and morph targets (weights bound to parameters) | proven in the host harness: clip and morph weights blend the pose, each with a reference lens and a proof | built, no hardware yet | built |
| 2D sprite and text nodes (image overlay, built-in-font text) | proven in the host harness, each with a reference lens and a proof | built, no hardware yet | built |
| Animated GIF video textures (sprite plays a decoded clip) | proven in the host harness: a sprite decodes a shipped GIF and advancing the lens clock draws a different frame, with a reference lens and a proof | built, no hardware yet | built |
| MP4 video textures (video.texture node streams a clip off the hardware decoder) | proven in the host harness: a recorded clip decodes back onto a sprite through AVAssetReader and advances off the frame clock, bit-stable, with a reference lens and a proof | deterministic stub; AMediaCodec decode queued | deterministic stub; browser decode queued |
| Lens particles (deterministic CPU fountain, GPU points) | proven in the host harness: the fountain falls, settled differs from initial, bit-stable across runs | pure-Zig sim, runs on device | pure-Zig sim, runs in browser |

"Demonstrated" means executed on the real target through the public
path; "built" means the code exists and compiles but no physical device
has run it yet. Rows appear as capabilities land. World tracking always comes from the
platform, ARKit on iOS, ARCore on Android, WebXR in the browser, behind one
core interface. A lens that wants world data falls back to a defined preview
behavior when tracking is unavailable.
