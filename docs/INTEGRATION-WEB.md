# Integrating gosslens on the web

The path from a checkout to a camera preview with a lens on it in a web app.
The [TypeScript SDK](../sdk/ts/README.md) is the surface; the
[demo](../sdk/ts/demo) is a full working page.

The web build is different from the native ones in one way worth stating up
front: the engine is WebAssembly, and the browser will not let a package fetch
a `.wasm` from inside `node_modules` the way a native app links an archive. So
`@gosslens/core` ships the JavaScript wrapper only, and you host the wasm and
model assets yourself and hand the SDK their URLs. The SDK never guesses a
path.

## Build the assets

    zig build wasm-emscripten           # gosslens_web.js/.wasm, WebGL2
    zig build wasm-emscripten-webgpu     # gosslens_web.js/.wasm, WebGPU
    zig build tracking-wasm              # gosslens_tracking.wasm
    zig build fetch-models               # the ML .task/.tflite bundles

WebGPU and WebGL2 are two separate engine artifacts, not a runtime switch.
Serve both, plus the tracking module and whichever model bundles your lenses
use, from your own static host.

## Install

`@gosslens/core` is not published to a registry yet. Consume it from this
checkout as a workspace dependency (the demo does), pointing your workspace at
`sdk/ts`:

    { "dependencies": { "@gosslens/core": "workspace:*" } }

or a direct path while you develop:

    { "dependencies": { "@gosslens/core": "file:../gosslens/sdk/ts" } }

Run `bun run build` in `sdk/ts` first so `dist/` exists. The imports below use
the package name either way.

## The render loop

`GossPreviewSession` does the engine, renderer, session, and capture loop in
one call - most apps want this:

    import { GossPreviewSession, pickEngineUrl } from "@gosslens/core";

    const wasmJsUrl = await pickEngineUrl(webgpuUrl, webgl2Url);
    const preview = await GossPreviewSession.create(canvas, wasmJsUrl);
    preview.activateLens(manifestJson);

`pickEngineUrl` confirms a real WebGPU adapter before choosing, and falls back
to the WebGL2 URL. If you drive the loop yourself, the pieces are public too:

    import { Gosslens, GossEngine, GossSession } from "@gosslens/core";

    const gosslens = await Gosslens.load(canvas, wasmJsUrl);
    const engine = GossEngine.create(gosslens);
    await engine.initRenderer(canvas);
    const session = GossSession.create(engine);

    session.submitFrameRgbaCopy(rgba, width * 4, width, height);
    engine.renderFrame(session);

## Camera controls

The engine never touches the camera. It holds declarative intent you set,
normalizes it, and hands it back for you to apply as getUserMedia track
constraints. The controls live on `GossSession`, so reach them through
`preview.session` if you took the `GossPreviewSession` path:

    session.setCameraControls({ ...session.cameraControls(), flashMode: 2, zoomFactor: 2 });

    const applied = session.cameraControls();
    await track.applyConstraints({ advanced: [{ zoom: applied.zoomFactor,
                                                 torch: applied.torch === 1 }] });

`GossCameraControls` also carries focus and exposure mode and points, the
exposure bias, and the front-camera mirror-save policy. `setRecordingPolicy`/
`recordingPolicy` (clip cap, segment and loop mode, speed preset, mic mute,
save-original, stabilization) round-trips for your `MediaRecorder`, and
`setCaptureUi`/`captureUi` (grid, level, shutter mode, self-timer, night mode,
front-screen flash) for the capture chrome you draw. The engine validates and
clamps every field; you read it back and apply it.

## Tracking

Face, hand, pose, and segmentation run in the `gosslens_tracking.wasm` module,
off the main thread in a Worker. Each tracker takes the module bytes and a
model bundle and returns its result synchronously inside the worker:

    // tracking-worker.ts
    import { GossFaceTracker } from "@gosslens/core";

    const moduleBytes = await (await fetch(trackingWasmUrl)).arrayBuffer();
    const tracker = await GossFaceTracker.create(moduleBytes, faceTaskBytes);
    // per frame, on RGBA pixels from the camera canvas:
    const result = tracker.process(rgba, width, height, timestampUs);

[`demo/tracking-worker.ts`](../sdk/ts/demo/tracking-worker.ts) is the reference
worker, and [`demo/track-worker.ts`](../sdk/ts/demo/track-worker.ts) stands all
four pipelines up over still images. Feed a segmentation mask back to the
session with `setSegmentationMask` so a lens can composite against it.

The `.task`/`.tflite` bundles (`face_landmarker.task`, `gesture_recognizer.task`,
`pose_landmarker_full.task`, `selfie_multiclass.tflite`) are the ones
`fetch-models` writes; host and fetch the ones your lenses use.

The single-face path is `setFaceLandmarks`. To fan a face-anchored lens out
across every face in frame, hand the engine the faces you tracked this frame:

    session.submitFaces(faces);      // GossFaceInput[], up to GOSS_FACE_MAX; [] clears
    for (let i = 0; i < session.faceCount(); i++) {
      const face = session.faceResultAt(i);
    }

`submitBodies` is the multi-person equivalent, reaching every tracked figure:

    session.submitBodies(bodies);    // GossPoseInput[], up to GOSS_BODY_MAX; [] clears
    for (let i = 0; i < session.bodyCount(); i++) {
      const body = session.bodyResultAt(i);
    }

`faceRegion` returns the tracked point of a named attach point for pinning
content - forehead, glabella, nose tip, chin, an eye, a cheek, an ear, or a mouth
corner:

    const p = session.faceRegion(GossFaceRegion.Forehead);

`bodyJoint` is the body-skeleton equivalent, pinning to a shoulder, wrist, or
knee of the tracked figure:

    const joint = session.bodyJoint(GossBodyJoint.LeftWrist);

`handJoint` is the hand equivalent, pinning to a fingertip or the wrist of the
tracked hand:

    const tip = session.handJoint(GossHandJoint.IndexTip);

The face tracker also drives the `gaze.*` and `head.nod`/`head.shake`/`head.tilt`
lens triggers; `camera.*` follow the camera controls and `geo.in_region` the
geofence below. The full grammar is in [the lens spec](../lenses/SPEC.md).

## Depth

If the XR session was granted `depth-sensing`, feed each frame's depth so a
depth-aware lens can occlude content behind real geometry. The map is metres per
pixel, row major, with the near and far range it spans:

    const info = frame.getDepthInformation(view);   // WebXR depth-sensing
    // read info into a Float32Array of metres, then:
    session.submitDepth(depth, info.width, info.height, 0.1, 5.0);

An empty array clears it. The engine keeps the latest map for the occlusion pass.

## Geofilters

A lens can gate on place. Feed a location fix from the Geolocation API and
describe the region the lens belongs to; the engine decides membership in wasm
and the fix never leaves the page:

    navigator.geolocation.watchPosition((pos) => {
      session.submitLocation(pos.coords.latitude, pos.coords.longitude,
                             pos.coords.accuracy, pos.timestamp * 1000);
    });
    session.setGeofence(lat, lon, 150);

`setGeofenceBBox` and `setGeofencePolygon` describe a box or a ring instead;
`setGeoAccuracy` sets the worst fix that still counts as inside, and
`clearGeofence` drops the gate. Membership drives the lens grammar's
`geo.in_region` trigger.

## Brush

Freehand strokes composite over the frame. Open a stroke, push normalized points,
and close it; the engine keeps the undo/redo stack and hands back the ribbon
(x, y, r, g, b, a per vertex):

    session.setBrushStyle(1, 0.4, 0.6, 1, 0.01);
    session.setBrushMode(3);              // 0 pen, 1 highlighter, 2 marker, 3 neon
    session.beginStroke();
    session.addStrokePoint(nx, ny);
    session.endStroke();
    const ribbon = session.brushVertices();

`setARBrushStyle`/`beginARStroke`/`addARStrokePoint(x, y, z)`/`endARStroke` are the
world-anchored twin: points are pushed in the world frame world tracking reports,
so a stroke stays fixed in the scene.

## Lives and calls

The web is the easy case: the rendered canvas is already a live video source.
`canvas.captureStream()` hands you a `MediaStreamTrack` of the composited,
lens-baked output with no readback and no copy - publish it straight to
LiveKit or any WebRTC peer:

    const track = canvas.captureStream(30).getVideoTracks()[0];
    // publish `track` through your LiveKit room or RTCPeerConnection

Keep the render loop running (`renderFrame` per frame) and the track carries
every composited frame. Reach for `captureLiveFrame` only when you need the
raw pixels (BGRA by default) rather than a track. For audio, `submitAudio`
feeds mic samples in for audio-reactive lenses, and `mixOutputAudio` folds the
lens's own sound into the mic block you are about to publish and returns the
mixed interleaved s16 for your outgoing WebRTC audio track (pass `null` for the
mic to send the lens sound over silence). `pullAudio` still pulls the lens sound
alone for local WebAudio playback with no call in progress.

## Method names

The operation names match the other SDKs: `GossEngine.create(gosslens)`,
`GossSession.create(engine)`, `submitFrameRgbaCopy`, `renderFrame`. The full
table is in [API.md](API.md).
