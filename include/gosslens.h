/*
 * Gosslens C ABI.
 *
 * This header is the one boundary between the core and every SDK. It is
 * hand-written, versioned, and frozen per minor release: within a major
 * version symbols and struct layouts are only ever appended, never changed
 * or reordered. The abi gate diffs this surface on every change.
 *
 * Conventions:
 *   - Every symbol is prefixed goss_.
 *   - Handles are opaque. Creation returns ownership; goss_*_destroy releases
 *     it. A destroy call accepts null and does nothing.
 *   - Functions that can fail return goss_status. No errno, no exceptions.
 *   - Descriptor structs are plain data with fixed layouts, documented and
 *     static-asserted byte for byte.
 *
 * Threading:
 *   - An engine and its sessions are confined to the thread that created
 *     them, called the graph thread, unless a function is marked any-thread.
 *   - goss_abi_version is any-thread and must be the first call an SDK makes;
 *     a major mismatch means the SDK must refuse to run.
