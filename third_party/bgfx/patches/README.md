Local patches applied on top of the pinned bgfx source after vendor-sync
extracts and verifies it (see pin.zon's archive_sha256, which stays
anchored to the pristine, pre-patch archive - these patches are never
part of what's cryptographically pinned, only what layers on top of it).
Applied in filename order by tools/vendor_sync.zig; a patch that no
longer applies cleanly against the pinned commit fails the sync loudly.

0001-webgpu-timer-query-noop.patch
Real, verified finding (2026-08-17), not assumed: bgfx's WebGPU backend
(src/renderer_webgpu.cpp) calls GPUCommandEncoder.writeTimestamp() once
per frame, unconditionally, from TimerQueryWGPU::begin()/end(). This
method does not exist on Chrome's shipping GPUCommandEncoder.prototype
- confirmed directly against a real browser (Chrome 151), checking the
prototype itself before any device or feature negotiation, so this is
not a missing-feature-request issue. The WebGPU spec moved timestamp
writes off the command encoder entirely, onto timestampWrites in
GPUComputePassDescriptor/GPURenderPassDescriptor instead. Calling the
removed method throws inside an unhandled promise rejection and blocks
bgfx_init from ever completing on this backend.

Verified before patching, not assumed: bgfx's own perfStats.gpuTimeBegin/
gpuTimeEnd are already hardcoded to 0 in this same file's frame()
function, and no code anywhere in renderer_webgpu.cpp ever resolves
TimerQueryWGPU's query set or reads its timestamp buffer back to the
CPU (unlike OcclusionQueryWGPU, which has real resolve/mapAsync logic).
The GPU-timer-stats readback pipeline for this backend is already
vestigial in the pinned commit, independent of this patch. Skipping the
write changes no value any caller can observe; this project does not
consume bgfx's GPU timer stats.

Filed upstream: https://github.com/bkaradzic/bgfx/issues/3902

Update, 2026-08-18: bkaradzic landed a real upstream fix for issue 3902
(commit 1eb770679fcb451d65cc27cf5b3f5297a675b477, "WebGPU: Fixed timer
query. Fixes #3902. (#3903)") - TimerQueryWGPU now writes timestamps
through GPUComputePassDescriptor.timestampWrites instead of the removed
GPUCommandEncoder.writeTimestamp() method, gates on a real
WGPUFeatureName_TimestampQuery support check, and resolves/reads the
buffer back per frame. This supersedes the no-op workaround here. Not
yet adopted - re-pinning bgfx to pick this up and dropping this patch
is real follow-on work, not done in this pass.

0002-shaderc-asmjs-wgsl-language-define.patch
Real, verified finding (2026-08-17): tools/shaderc/shaderc.cpp picks the
BGFX_SHADER_LANGUAGE_* preprocessor define per (platform, profile) pair.
Every platform branch (android, linux, windows, the default/else case)
has a ShadingLang::WGSL arm that sets BGFX_SHADER_LANGUAGE_WGSL=1; the
"asm.js" platform branch (the one this project's web build uses) does
not - it unconditionally sets the GLSL/ESSL defines instead, regardless
of profile. With BGFX_SHADER_LANGUAGE_WGSL left at its default-0, none
of bgfx_shader.sh's WGSL-target translations apply (bvec2 -> bool2, and
friends), so the raw GLSL-style source is handed to glslang's HLSL
front end unmodified and fails to parse. Confirmed directly: before
this patch, `shaderc -p wgsl --platform asm.js` failed with HLSL parse
errors on bgfx_shader.sh's own header content; after it, compilation
proceeds into Tint's SPIR-V-to-WGSL path. This is a host build tool
only (shaderc runs at build time to generate shader blobs) - it does
not touch the runtime bgfx library, so the blast radius is the shader
compiler's own source translation, nothing more.

Not yet filed upstream - same bkaradzic/bgfx repo as 0001 above, once
confirmed.

0003-webgpu-readtexture-wait-any.patch
Real, verified finding (2026-08-17): TextureWGPU::readTexture() maps its
staging buffer with WGPUCallbackMode_AllowProcessEvents, then waits with
a bare `while (!s_done) { wgpuInstanceProcessEvents(m_instance); }` spin
loop. Under Emscripten's emdawnwebgpu port, this never resolves - the
JS-side implementation of AllowProcessEvents callbacks needs a real
yield back to the browser's own event loop for the underlying
GPUBuffer.mapAsync() promise to settle, which a synchronous busy spin
never gives it. Confirmed directly: CPU pinned at 100% indefinitely,
never completing, versus the same call completing in ~160ms after the
fix. The fix mirrors what this same file's own adapter/device
negotiation code already does successfully for the identical situation
- WGPUCallbackMode_WaitAnyOnly plus a waitForFuture(WGPUFutureWaitInfo&)
call, which emdawnwebgpu's Asyncify-aware JS implementation actually
supports (its non-Asyncify branch is a literal
`abort('TODO: Implement asyncify-free WaitAny for timeout=0')`,
confirming WaitAnyOnly is the intended primitive here, not
AllowProcessEvents).

Not yet filed upstream - same bkaradzic/bgfx repo as 0001/0002 above,
once confirmed.

0004-webgpu-canvas-texture-per-task.patch
Real, verified finding (2026-09-02): a canvas surface's current texture is
only valid within the JS task that acquired it - the compositor destroys it
when the task yields - but SwapChainWGPU cached the next frame's texture
view across present() (and configure() cached the first frame's during
init), so on wasm32-emscripten every frame submitted against a destroyed
swapchain texture (Dawn: "Destroyed texture ... used in a submit"). The
patch acquires the view lazily inside the frame that renders with it
(currentTextureView()), drops the eager acquires on emscripten, and also
invalidates a view cached by a frame that skipped its present, since the
acquired texture dies at the task boundary either way.
